# RBXStudioCameraBypass
There is a issue about a roblox studio camera being at fixed, I found a solution for this! (Download, it's free.)




Windows Versions (will not work in windows xp because you can't play roblox in windows xp): C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Roblox\Plugins




if you don't have windows and you use something else, find Plugins and open plugin item. (If it gives you a error, you might have to create new item named Plugins.)
